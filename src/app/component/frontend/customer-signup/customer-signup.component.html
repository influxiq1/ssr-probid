Though this is such a vast industry with a strong command of overall retail sales, there is heavy reliance on consumer trends and tastes when it comes to automobile sales.</p>
          <p class="inner">Did you know that Gen Y represents two of five car buyers with estimates of them purchasing 75 percent of vehicles by 2025?</p>
          <p>Research has shown that members of the millennial generation want out of the car-buying experience. Members of Gen Y have grown up with the internet and online shopping, and so, naturally, they are looking for a similar experience when it comes to buying a car.</p>
          <p>They use the internet more than any other consumer group. They want car shopping to be a low-pressure, high variety and an immediate results experience with no haggling. They want to have all the information they need upfront with no surprises. With the New Millennium Used-Car Purchase Method, we have developed a way to streamline the car buying process with our Gen-Y friendly auto auction software. This has allowed our consumers the freedom and capability of making their car purchases the way they want to.</p>
          <h4>It is time for the industry to change tactics and incorporate methods and ideas that serve towards attracting the younger Americans.</h4>
          <h2>WE ARE THAT CHANGE.</h2>

            <p>The way ProBidAuto is set up is so much more efficient, as consumers do not have to go searching for their desired cars across multiple Used-Car Auctions. They will be presented with REAL-TIME retail prices of auctioned cars from various auction houses, all under the same roof. Once they have accounted for their choices and decided on the prices, they simply need to push at the needle to get their hands on the car at retail prices, or even LESS!</p>
          </span>
          <span class="revocontentbottom">
            <p>The ideal way to buy cars for the consumer is through ProBidAuto. The dealership will buy cars that already have potential buyers – this eliminates the high cost of maintaining and buying cars for the lot, allowing us to avoid placing high price-tags on the cars. Consumers won’t miss this anyway – the trend of buying cars is already turning to internet sales. This is the direction the industry is headed and we have only helped to bring it closer to you.</p>
